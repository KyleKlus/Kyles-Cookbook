# Seitan (chicken meat substitute)

## Ingredients

| Quantity | Ingredients |
| ------ | ------------------------------- |
| 600 g | Flour |
| 360 ml | Water (always 60-65% hydration) |
| - | Broth |
| - | Paprika spice |
| - | Pepper |
| - | Soy sauce |
| - | Garlic |

## Preparation

1. knead the flour and water into a dough.
2. cover the dough with water in a bowl and let it rest for about 2 hours.
3. now drain the water and fill the bowl again with fresh water.
4. massage / knead the dough, washing out the wheat starch and then let it rest again for 10 min (tip: you can keep the water mixed with wheat starch for about the first two washes and use this as a sauce thickener).
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 about 6 times until the water is almost clear.
6. take out the dough and cut it into 3 strips on a board, but still keeping the 3 strips connected at the top.
7. now intertwine the 3 strips as in a braid and then knot the braid with itself as many times as possible.
8. after this prepare a spicy broth (Here you are given complete freedom, how it should taste now), in which the dough is then cooked for about 30 min on low heat.
9. then leave the dough in the broth to infuse overnight.
10. now you can pull apart the individual fibers of the dough and cut it into individual pieces depending on the desired size and then fry them.
