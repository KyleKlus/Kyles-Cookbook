# Yeast plait with filling

## Ingredients (1 yeast plait)

| Quantity | Ingredients for the dough |
| ---------------- | -------------------- |
| 500 g | Flour |
| 100 g | Sugar |
| 50 g | Butter |
| 1 pinch | Salt |
| 1 pkg. | Dry yeast |
| 250 ml | Lukewarm milk |

| Ingredients for the filling |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 100g | Soft butter |
| - | Sugar (**optional** brown sugar) |
| - | Cinnamon |
| - | Cardamon **Optional** |
| - | Raisins **Optional** |
| - | Water (**optional** lemon juice) |
| 125g | Powdered sugar |

## Preparation for the dough

1. put flour in a bowl and make a well in it.
2. Then add the yeast, sugar and a little lukewarm milk, cover with flour and let rise for about 15 minutes in a warm place.
3. then knead, add the rest of the ingredients and knead again vigorously.
4. let rest for another 30 min.

## Preparation for the filling

1. mix butter and sugar (amount according to taste and to a paste consistency) to a spreadable paste.
2. Stir in remaining spices according to taste.

## Preparation for the yeast plait

1. roll out the dough into a rectangle about 5mm thick (about 15-18cm wide and as long as it goes) and cut lengthwise into 3 strips, but with a connecting piece about 5cm wide at the top to keep the 3 parts together.
2. then slightly angle the left and right strips, so that you can roll out each strip again widthwise, as thin as possible.
3. now spread the sugar-butter paste and other toppings on the entire dough.
4. roll up all strips widthwise and braid all strands into a braid (pressing the open end together).
5. now brush the dough with milk or beaten egg and put in the oven at about 160 degrees until the surface is golden brown.
6. while this is happening, make a glaze with the water (**Optional:** lemon juice) and the powdered sugar, which should have a viscous consistency, so very carefully add the liquid.
7. now let the yeast plait cool and then brush with a sugar glaze or drizzle artistically.
