# Pizza (Simple version)

## Ingredients (approx. 2 servings)

| Quantity | Ingredients |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 1 | Tomato sauce |
| 375 g | Flour |
| 213 g | Lukewarm water |
| 11 g | Salt |
| 1 tbsp | Olive oil |
| 1 tsp | Sugar |
| 1 pkg. | Dry yeast |
| - | Cheese |
| - | Oregano |
| - | Topping |

## Preparation

1. dissolve sugar and yeast in lukewarm water and let stand 15 min.
2. mix flour and salt in a bowl and form a hollow in the center.
3. pour the yeast mixture into the bowl, poke the flour into the bowl with a bread knife or a mixing bowl and stir/pre-knead with the respective mixing bowl until you have a loose dough.
4. Now knead the dough by hand in the bowl until all the flour is in the dough and then knead the dough on a work surface for 10 min (If the dough is too sticky add a little more flour).
5. put the dough covered in the refrigerator as long as possible to rise (minimum 1-2 h and maximum 24 h).
6. make the tomato sauce from the basic recipe.
7. Preheat oven to 180-200Â° convection.
8. knead the dough again lightly on a floured work surface and divide it in 2.
9. dough in hand form / press into a patty.
10. hold the dough at the edge and walk along the edge, so that the dough pulls itself long by its own weight. Caution!!! Do not let the dough become too thin, otherwise it tears, here rather if it does not work so put the dough on the tray and there form it into an approx. 28cm slice by pressing and pulling.
11. now cover the pizza and put it in the oven until it and the cheese is brown (about 10 min). Last but not least, sprinkle with oregano.
