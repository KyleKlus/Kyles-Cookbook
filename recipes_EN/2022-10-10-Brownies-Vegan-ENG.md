# Brownies (Vegan)

## Ingredients (approx. 12 pieces)

| Quantity | Ingredients |
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
| 250 g | Dark chocolate |
| 200 g | Flour |
| 2 tsp | Baking powder |
| 200 g | Sugar |
| 50 g | Baking cocoa |
| 5 tbsp. | Applesauce |
| 100 g | Sunflower oil |
| 150 ml | Plant based milk |

## Preparation

1. Coarsely chop 200 g of dark chocolate and melt in a water bath. Let the chocolate cool for about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, mix 200 g flour with 2 tsp baking powder, 200 g sugar and 50 g baking cocoa in a bowl.
2. Preheat oven to 180 C° top/bottom heat (convection oven: 160 C°). Grease a small baking tray (approx. 28 x 23 cm) or line with baking paper. Add 5 tablespoons applesauce, 100 g sunflower oil and 150 ml plant based milk to the flour mixture and stir everything together. Now add the melted dark chocolate and stir again briefly. Pour the batter into the baking dish and smooth out.
3. Bake brownies in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes. Check with a toothpick if the brownies are done. There should still be some moist crumbs hanging on the toothpick, so that the brownies are still nice and juicy. Let brownies cool completely.
4. Coarsely chop the remaining dark chocolate and also melt in a water bath. With a spoon, spread liquid dark chocolate in stripes over the brownies. Let the chocolate set, then cut the brownies into pieces with a hot knife. The recipe makes about 12 pieces. The brownies can be stored in an airtight container for about 3-4 days.
