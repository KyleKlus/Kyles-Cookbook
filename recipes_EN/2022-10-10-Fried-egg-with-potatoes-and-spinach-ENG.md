2. now mix 1 tsp of starch with 1 tbsp of water in a cup and add it with the egg yolks.
3. Now stir the remaining ingredients.
4. heat the 3 tablespoons of oil in a pan until bubbles form on sticks when held in the oil.
5. pour the egg mixture into the pan and let the egg rest until a firm base is formed.
6. move the solid egg to one side of the pan and let the uncooked rest flow to the other side.
7. angle the pan so that only the liquid side is on the stove and again get the previously described process until no more egg flows down.
