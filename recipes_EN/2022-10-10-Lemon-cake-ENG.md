# Lemon cake

## Ingredients

| Quantity | Ingredients |
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
| 200 g | Soft butter |
| 150 g | Sugar |
| 4 | Eggs |
| 2 tablespoons | Lemon juice |
| 250 g | Flour |
| 1 pkg | Baking powder |
| 1 teaspoon | Lemon zest
| 300 g | Powdered sugar |
| 1 | Lemon |
| 1 | Lemon zest |

## Preparation

1. Preheat oven to 180 C° (convection oven: 160 C°). Grease the loaf pan (length 25 cm) well. Mix 200 g butter, 150 g sugar and 2 tablespoons lemon juice briefly. Gradually stir in 4 eggs.
2. Mix 250 g flour, 1 pkg baking powder and lemon zest. Stir into the butter-sugar mixture. Bake the cake in the preheated oven for about 45 minutes. Cover cake after about 30 minutes with some aluminum foil, so that it does not get too dark. Remove cake from the oven and let cool for about 10 minutes!
3. For the glaze, mix the lemon juice of one lemon and 300 g powdered sugar so that the glaze is thick (if it is too liquid, just add more powdered sugar).
4. carefully prick the cake with a fork several times while it is still warm. Pour the icing on top. This will make the cake even juicier! The cake makes about 12 pieces. If you make the cake in a normal loaf pan, prick the cake still in the mold and pour some lemon juice over it. Let the cake cool, remove from the mold and only then pour frosting. Allow the icing to set.
