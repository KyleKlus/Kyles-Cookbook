# Pickled red onions

## Ingredients

| Quantity | Ingredients |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------ |
| - | Red onions |
| - | Vinegar |
| - | Water |
| - | Freezer bag |
| - | Rubber band |

## Preparation

1. peel as many onions as desired, halve and cut longest into strips (from the root to the stalk).
2. equal parts vinegar and water (so much that the onions can be completely under the liquid) in a pot and bring to a boil. 3.
3. put the onions in a jar or other tightly sealable container and add the liquid after boiling.
4. last but not least, fill a freezer bag with water, close it tightly (twist and then put a rubber band around it), and put it in the container so that the onions are always under the surface (otherwise they won't keep very long).
5. Now you can store the onions for about 2 months without them going bad. You can use them as soon as they have cooled down.
