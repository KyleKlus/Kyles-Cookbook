# Choux pastry (cream puff)

## Ingredients (approx. 7 pieces)

| Quantity | Ingredients |
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
| 2 tbsp. | Butter |
| 150 ml | Water |
| 1 tsp | Sugar |
| 100 g | Flour |
| 1 pinch | Salt |
| 3 | Eggs |

## Preparation

1. preheat oven to 220 C° (200 C° convection oven).
2. Bring 150 ml water with 2 tbsp butter, 1 pinch salt and 1 tsp sugar to a boil in a saucepan.
3. Add 100 g of flour and stir with a wooden spoon to form a thick dough. Continue to stir over medium heat, the dough dumpling repeatedly from all sides with the wooden spoon on the hot pot bottom. This will “burn off� the dough and create the typical cavities during baking. This creates a white layer on the bottom of the pot. Remove the pot from the heat.
4. put the dough in a bowl, let cool for 3 minutes. Then beat in 3 eggs, one at a time, thoroughly with the whisks of a hand mixer. Beat each egg until a smooth dough is formed again. The dough is ready when it shines nicely and falls gently from a spoon.
5. Pour the dough into a piping bag with any nozzle and pipe the desired shapes onto the baking sheet, spacing them apart. Bake in the oven for about 25 minutes. Do not open the oven during the baking time. Allow the pastry to cool slightly and make into eclairs, cream puffs, etc. as desired.
